# norepo
A place for different things that I want backed up, but don't need their own repos

Contents:


* APISkeleton: a design-driven API in Goa, a Go DSL and code-generation tool.
* Nats: learning the nats message queue (think Rabbit MQ, but faster?).
* Progenitor: experimenting with two-way EDN<->Protobuf conversion


Dependencies

```sh
# I am using the newest versions of the various compilers/REPLs needed.
# If any custom instructions or commands are needed they'll go here.
```
