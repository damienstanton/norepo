# norepo
A place for different things that I want backed up, but don't need their own repos

Contents:


* APISkeleton: a design-driven API in Goa, a Go DSL and code-generation tool.
* DesktopElectro: experimenting with desktop + mobile in one isomorphic TypeScript app.
* DummyGen: fulfilling a work need to generate Solr-friendly random data.
* IonicServer:  experimenting with embedding a concurrent, safe web server written in Go in an Ionic/Electron app (using GopherJS cross-compilation).
* Microservice: learning Go-Kit for back end microservices.
* Nats: learning the nats message queue (think Rabbit MQ, but faster?).
* Purescript: learning the Haskell that compiles to JavaScript. Beautiful.
* Clojurian: keeping my Clj/Cljs chops up after several months without using the lanugage. Homoiconcity is just so damn wonderful.


Dependencies

```sh
# I am using the newest versions of the various compilers/REPLs needed.
